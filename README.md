# OpenChaos.dev

**[openchaos.dev](https://openchaos.dev)**

A self-evolving open source project. Each day, the community votes on PRs, and the top-voted one is merged.

**The website IS the repo. The repo IS the website.**

## How It Works

1. Anyone submits a PR
2. Community votes via reactions on the PR:
  - 👍 (Thumbs Up) counts as +1
  - 👎 (Thumbs Down) counts as -1
3. Every **day at 19:00 UTC**, the most-voted PR gets merged
4. Vercel auto-deploys
5. Repeat forever

## Submitting a PR

When creating your PR, you can include an **optional pitch** — a short message to persuade voters why your change should win. Add it as an HTML comment in the PR body (it won't be visible in GitHub's rendered view, but will appear on the OpenChaos website):

```markdown
<!-- chaos-pitch: Your compelling pitch here -->
```

**Example:**
```markdown
<!-- chaos-pitch: Adds dark mode toggle — finally no more burning retinas at 3am! -->
```

Your pitch will be displayed on your PR card. Keep it concise (max 256 characters) and make it count!

## Rules

- **Vote**: Add a 👍 reaction to support a change, or a 👎 reaction to oppose it
- **Highest Score Wins**: The winner is determined by (Total 👍) - (Total 👎)
- **Ties favor the New**: If scores are equal, the **newest PR** (created most recently) wins
- **Must have rhyming words**: Only PRs that contain **two rhyming words** in the title are eligible for merge (e.g., "botch" and "watch")
- **CI must pass**: If the build fails, the PR is not eligible
- **No merge conflicts**: PRs with conflicts at merge time are skipped; the next highest PR wins
- **No malware**: Maintainer can reject obviously malicious content
- Any time the maintainer pushes code to main without following the community voting process indicated above, he must post to his X account "I'm a naughty boy" with a link to the Github commit page.

## What Can Be Changed

Everything. Including these rules.

Someone could submit a PR that:
- Changes the UI completely
- Adds a whole new feature
- Removes something
- Adds a backend/database
- Turns it into a game

If it passes CI and gets votes, it can win.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Vercel (auto-deploy)
